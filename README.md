Functionality of the website (descriptions of each of the pages and what they do)
Index.Html is the homepage that explains the whole premise of the website and why we believe animals should have rights. After this are pages where it explains what is done to animals like experiments and unnecessary hunting.

How did JavaScript expand the functionality of your website?
It changed how we could style the website, make it more interactive with the user, and emphasize the important reasons why we believe animal rights are needed.

What features are you the most proud of?
We are most proud of the carousel added with a zoom in and out loop that is added to emphasize what is being shown.

What would you add if you had more time?
I would have added the youtube link after clicking the button, subheading with articles on the side of page, and make it more aethesically pleasing for what we are going for.
